        question="What is Escrow"
        cite="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp"
        answer={`Escrow is a financial process used when two parties take part in a transaction and there is uncertainty about the fulfillment of their obligations. Situations that may use escrow can involve internet transactions, banking, intellectual property, real estate, mergers and acquisitions, law, and more.
        Consider a company that is selling goods internationally. That company requires assurance that it will receive payment when the goods reach their destination. The buyer, for their part, is prepared to pay for the goods only if they arrive in good condition.
        The buyer can place the funds in escrow with an agent with instructions to disburse them to the seller once the goods arrive in a suitable state. This way, both parties are protected and the transaction can proceed.`}
